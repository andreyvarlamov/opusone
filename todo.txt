TODO:
- Mesh shader improvements
    - Handle vertex colors with UVs (+ colors and no UVs and vice versa)
    - Handle normal transforms for skinned meshes
    - Basic lighting
- More rendering
    - Debug rendering:
        - More bounding shapes: spheres, capsules, wireframe triangles;
        - Make render state management more efficient
    - Consider switching to only one render unit marker type per render unit
    - Render text and immediate UI for debugging
    - Some kind of screen-space visualization tools. for example plots
    - Instancing
- Collisions
    - Basic AABBs
    - AABB Triangle
    - Basic mouse picking
- Improving animation
    - Animation blending
    - Animation states
    - Determine the best export setup (ease of use in dcc + performance)
    - Handling edge cases/not quite correct export setup better
    - Numerical robustness - eliminate jitter (investigate, might not be such a big problem now)
    - Consider creating a custom Blender exporter
