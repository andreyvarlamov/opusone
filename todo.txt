TODO:
- Mesh shader improvements
	- Handle vertex colors with UVs (+ colors and no UVs and vice versa)
	- Handle normal transforms for skinned meshes
	- Basic lighting
- More rendering
	- Debug shapes: bounding boxes, spheres, capsules, wireframe triangles; vectors, points, coordinate systems
	- Render text and immediate UI for debugging
	- Some kind of screen-space visualization tools. for example plots
	- Instancing
- Collisions
	- Basic AABBs
	- AABB Triangle
	- Basic mouse picking
- Improving animation system
	- Animation blending
	- Animation states
	- Determine the best export setup (ease of use in dcc + performance)
	- Handling edge cases/not quite correct export setup better
	- Numerical robustness - eliminate jitter (investigate, might not be such a big problem now)
	- Consider creating a custom Blender exporter
